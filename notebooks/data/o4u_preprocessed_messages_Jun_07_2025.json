  "Open Lecture for Faculty and Students by Fyodor Stonyakin: \"Introduction to Nonsmooth Optimization\" as part of the seminar \"Innopolis. Science.\" Fyodor Sergeevich Stonyakin - Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Senior Researcher at the Laboratory of Advanced Combinatorics and Network Applications of MIPT, Head of the Department of Algebra and Functional Analysis at the Physical-Technical Institute of the Crimean Federal University named after V.I. Vernadsky. The lecture will cover the following topics: Optimization problems, involving finding maxima or minima, are frequently encountered and are introduced as early as school, during the study of derivatives. However, the apparatus of derivatives (or gradients, in the case of multivariable functions) is not suitable for all optimization problems. For example, the objective function for finding the minimal radius sphere covering a given set of points is non-differentiable at an infinite number of points. In this lecture, we will review examples of well-known nonsmooth optimization problems related to data analysis (such as LASSO regression and the problem of recovering a low-rank matrix with a non-Euclidean quality metric). These approaches can be useful in combating overfitting and addressing the instability of the standard least squares method in the presence of data anomalies or outliers. We will discuss key concepts from subgradient theory and numerical methods for solving nonsmooth optimization problems, highlighting some of their fundamental characteristics. In conclusion, we will briefly touch upon some contemporary works in this field and suggest topics for possible collaborative research (including course and thesis projects).

  "The talk within the research seminar of the AI Centre Alexey Petrenko (Ph.D., Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics SB RAS) will talk about Application of large language models to problem solving in elementary particle accelerator physics Abstract Large language models (ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Qwen) have turned out to be an unexpectedly effective tool for solving some typical problems in accelerator physics and engineering, such as: 1) fast writing of numerical schemes for calculating electromagnetic fields and tracking particles in these fields; 2) translating analytical descriptions of physical processes from theoretical publications into working programs; 3) use of open source libraries; 4) translating the description of accelerator structures from one format to another. Perhaps the greatest advantage of using large language models for such tasks is that the first working version of the program that solves the task, even if not completely, can be obtained very quickly. At the same time, the tendency of language models to hallucinate, especially when working with rare libraries and data formats, is a significant inconvenience. 7 May: 10:30-12:00 Russian Room 321 For staff and students",

  "Open lectures for Employees and Students by Fedor Stonyakin On a Modern Analog of the Smoothness Condition in Optimization and Vladimir Gordin Mathematics for Weather Forecasting and Climate Assessment as part of the \"Innopolis.Science\" Seminar Fedor Sergeevich Stonyakin is a Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Professor at Innopolis University, leading researcher at the Laboratory of Advanced Combinatorics and Network Applications, and Professor at the Department of Discrete Mathematics, Faculty of Physics, Mathematics and Computer Science, Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT). Fedor Stonyakin will talk about a recently proposed class of smooth optimization problems, in which the smoothness property of the objective functions is described using two parameters instead of a single Lipschitz constant of the gradient. This approach is motivated by objective functions arising in neural network training tasks and reflects the correlation between the growth of the Hessian matrix norms and the local smoothness constant. During the lecture, the speaker will discuss how this new smoothness class has advanced the theory of first-order optimization methods and what future research directions are possible in this area.

During the lecture, the expert will reveal the principles of Earth's structure and methods for analyzing long-term changes in atmospheric and oceanic systems.
